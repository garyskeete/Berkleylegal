Advanced applied holographic's 
the application of strengthening a holographic light particle until it becomes a solid infused with particles so as not to prevent its forces its mass is acceleration its properties it's consistencies it's comprisement from acting and performing as it normally would if it were a light application

Holographic particle infuser so you take the application of a copy and paste method an application of a photocopier of a 3-D printer And then you have the application In holographic light being able to duplicate a pattern or holographic's being able to replicate to solidify to liquefy to produce in the Gaseous state an element that is created by man in order to function in virtual reality in animation in holographic's in many aspects of science and technology as a real-world application
  

So the idea is to take a photocopier make it comply and transfer to imaging the written word and photographs combine it with medical machinery DNA technology cloning teleportation time travel and turn it into a dispenser for living organisms from the past present and future
