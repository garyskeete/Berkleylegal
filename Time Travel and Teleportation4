Taking the stem cells and applied mathematics and physics to acquire a state of juxtaposition in particle physics for partial reality partial assimilation partial self-assembly of poly more isolation the actual attending of surgical glue for self-assembly and the application of dissolving
The attainment of the state of longevity for genetics by applying the positioning of self-assembly to stuff sells the application of an exploded view of fragmented stem cell to create the creek scenario for a stem cell application to apply to genetics DNA molecular biology application of cell biology in part of it all the partial recognition of parts of subcells to initialize real-time application for polymerization self-assembly completion of regenerative parts And reanimation
The realization of the importance of this in brain chemistry and brain sciences for the regeneration of the brain for the juxtaposition of visual centres in the brain for positioning of thought cognition and rewiring of the brain for the removal of Psychopathic disorder of Alzheimer's of Glioblastoma of schizophrenia of mental disorders and mental diseases mental illnesses and mental ailments be expectation being the healing element as eventual outcome
