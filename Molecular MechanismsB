The aspect of teleportation and helium the agent for elevating elements and microscopic criteria to heights in the self assembly and translocation of regenerative biology of living entities be they synthetic natural metallic inorganic organic chemical elemental or compounds of solid liquid or gaseous.
The relevance of animation and holograms in the reversal of effects from one stage to another the purpose being the reversal of a crash scene an accident scene or the reversal of damage done by trauma to a body the reversal of microscopic elements to put them back in order reversing damage reversing stress reversing details of contamination or unwanted metastasis malignancy tumourigenesis or mutations reversal from stage four to stage zero cancer
So the details of the intrinsic interface between holograms animation with real to life situations placed in a overlay perhaps of suspended animation mix with augmented reality to overlay the intrinsic connection between The object being observed at the animation the connective Holographic A.I. location being the systematic bonding of elemental design to produce the effect of creating an object from animation to reality effects of illustration the effects of artistic rendering the effects of photographic memory the affects of copying transitioning and placing the object into a three-dimensional system of Cartesian mapping to create the correct scenario for holographic cloning in a sense of providing the synthesis of the correct chemical robotic holographic and biological sequences to produce a life form or living tissue.
