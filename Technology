<h1>Engineering Technology Concepts</h1>
<p>Part A 
the adaptation that the linear measure of a disease trait combinations can be drawn out in the form of calculations are epigenetic's in DNA be distinct formatting of a medication or chemistry or pharmacology that would follow the trait of pre-determined points upon the DNA travelling along bio valves for fluid analysis and thereby combatting at each step the viral traits the pathogen's the genetic deformity's that make the virus viable 
Part B 
medication chemistry pharmacology would adjust according to the predetermined analysis of the genetics and focus upon the weak points It's correcting any wrongs until it reached a state of health and homeostasis
Part C 
the medication or chemistry would be changing internally to adjust to the status of need in the predetermined analysis changing again to meet the next challenge and so on etcetera until all needs are met.</p>
