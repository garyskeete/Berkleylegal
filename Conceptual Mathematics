Addition subtraction multiplication and division the application being the photons the qubits involved in the mathematical expression mathematics 101 would be able to add the number of years the number of miles needed to travel the number of stars need to investigate the number of planets in the universe due to investigate adding the precise location adding the distance the time allocated and dividing into sections for exploration be multiplication of the effect of searching the overall atmosphere and the universe for signs of life The signs of spectral infiltration or spectral analysis for the discovery of new elements where the spectral trail ends the aspect of interdimensional travel through string theory The aspect of the subtraction of planets stars moons heavenly bodies where no effect has been for all four sides of life are signs of spectral trails yes but the process of illumination for life-sustaining planets for life science for details of search allocated is a scan to detect fossils or water or sides of whether or not the planet was life-sustaining at one time the aspect of division to create a quick scenario for the particle theory of matter and exploration to be separated
So we have the multiplication being added to the system of software that designates the control over the effect of the numerical quota the numerical multiplication the numerical subtraction a numerical division of the software when it comes to the application to the Universe and beyond it's searching and analysis of events in the spectral range as well as a living range the discovery range be neutral range
