Math physics chemistry biology mathematical probabilities of physics calculations in quantum theory such as the calculations of entanglement of teleportation of cryptography Hilbert space mathematics Euclidean geometry and fractal geometry algorithms the application of computerized programming in computational neuroscience for planning of integration and proliferation of memory recall and functionality of brain cells due to response to induced computational investigation and connectivity of relay in the junction between human and computer interface
The definition of mathematics involved in the proliferation of holograms the details needed to coincide with particles moving along a realm of linear anew non-linear algebra of systematic equations of details of movement of particles of comprising of healing elements organically inorganic synthetics natural metallic etcetera due to geometrical shape and alignment of the corresponding bonding Chemical signaling within the brain as well as cellular characteristics within the body of transport systems of cellular characteristics it communication of mitosis meiosis and longevity of ATP ADP telomeres immortal cells cloning and apoptosis of cancerous vs. normal cells so internal mechanisms represented by mathematical detail The application of mathematics involved in the transfer of holographic form in the collaboration from light to solid from light to liquid from light to gaseous
The tabulation of calculations of movement of sound of luminosity of mass of acceleration of velocity of pressures of of collaboration of internal mechanismsThe speed and distance and time of deliverance the overall acceptance of the body systems pharmacogenetics pharmacokinetics pharmacogenomics
Of the outside pressures of the environment the weather pollution details of nature of stresses all calculated to respond to the world it's atmospheres and the movement flexibility and collaboration coordination of humans
The application of this being non-invasive being tied to MRI potential being used and utilize to formulate plans for noninvasive surgery is for the application of medications for the distribution of cells throughout the body for the application of stem cell integration for the application of blood cell circulation for the application of tissue reengineering 
The hands-on application of statistics of modeling of applications to mathematics that are in applied science when it comes to the transfer of information from the mathematics to the patient for believing plans for intrinsic detail a design of formulated plans of medications of treatments of adaptations to experimental medicine explorative surgery and emergency and critical medicine
